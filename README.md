# Virtual Advent Calendar 2021

25 days of family events and challenges! Unlike last year, the events are **NOT** every day, because we're busy and that's *way* too much time to spend together.

## Why Virtual?

Because I don't want COVID.

## How Does It Work?

Tavi and Keita already used the form on the website to add events to the calendar. You can click each event to see the event's time, its description, links to the activities, and a list of any supplies you need.

## I Just Want to Add Stuff to the Wishlist

Y'all are greedy, but okay. Click the "Wishlist" button at the top of the screen. That will take you to the Wishlist page, where you can view everyone else's wishlist items and add your own. You can add the item's name, a description, and a link to find the item online. You can also set a **priority** for your gifts. And no, Josh, you can't set them all to the highest priority.

I'm trying to add new functionality this year, so stay tuned!
